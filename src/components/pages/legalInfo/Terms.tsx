            <h2>Terms of service</h2>
            <p>
                By registering to use and access the FOM Online, Inc. (“PhotoDrop”) websites located at photodrop.me and frameology.com, the PhotoDrop photo matching service, and texting bot (together, the “Service”), you are agreeing to be bound by these Terms of Use (the “Terms”). The Terms and our Privacy Policy (photodrop.me/terms) govern your use of our Service. By agreeing to these Terms, you represent that you are not a resident of the state of Illinois and will not upload photos to PhotoDrop taken in the state of Illinois. <b>Please read these Terms carefully. Unless you opt out of arbitration in accordance with the instructions below within 30 days of first agreeing to these Terms, you are agreeing that we will resolve certain disputes between us in binding arbitration on an individual basis rather than in jury trials or class actions.</b>
                <br /><br />
                If you do not agree with any of these terms, you are prohibited from using or accessing the Service. If you are accessing and using the Service on behalf of a company (such as your employer) or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to these Terms. In that case, “you” and “your” will refer to that company or other legal entity.
                <br /><br />
                Privacy Policy<br />
                Please refer to our Privacy Policy at https://photodrop.me/ privacy for information on how we collect, use and disclose information from our users. You acknowledge and agree that your use of the Service is subject to our Privacy Policy.
                <br /><br />
                Facial Recognition Technology<br />
                You agree that we may use facial recognition technology to allow us to identify photos on the Service in which you appear when you add a reference photo to the Service. For example, our facial recognition technology will compare your reference image with albums of photos to locate photos of you. In addition, your responses to potential photo matches may improve the accuracy of the facial recognition technology. By using the Service and adding a reference image, you consent to the use of facial recognition technology to identify photos on the Service in which you appear. You represent that the reference image photo added by you to the Service is you (or a family member for whom you are the legal guardian or have their consent) and that you are not impersonating or misrepresenting yourself as any other person or entity. For more information on our use of facial recognition technology, please see our Privacy Policy.
                <br /><br />
                Changes to Terms of Service<br />
                We may modify the Terms at any time, at our sole discretion. If we do so, we’ll let you know either by posting the modified Terms on the Site or through other communications. It’s important that you review the Terms whenever we modify them because if you continue to use the Service after we have posted modified Terms on the Site, you are indicating to us that you agree to be bound by the modified Terms. If you don’t agree to be bound by the modified Terms, then you may not use the Service anymore. Because our Service is evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Service, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.
                <br /><br />

                For purposes of these Terms: (a) “Content” means text, graphics, photos (including reference images), data (including feedback on proposed photo matches), images, music, software, audio, video, works of authorship of any kind, personally identifiable information, and information or other materials that are posted, generated, provided or otherwise made available through the Service; and (b) “User Content” means any Content that Account holders (including you) provide to be made available through the Service. Content includes without limitation User Content.
                <br /><br />
                Content Ownership, Responsibility and Removal<br />
                PhotoDrop does not claim any ownership rights in any User Content and nothing in these Terms will be deemed to restrict any rights that you may have to use and exploit your User Content. Subject to the foregoing, PhotoDrop and its licensors exclusively own all right, title and interest in and to the Service and Content, including all associated intellectual property rights. You acknowledge that the Service and Content are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of the United States and foreign countries. You agree not to remove, alter or obscure any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Service or Content.
                <br /><br />
                Rights in User Content Granted by You<br />
                By making any User Content available through the Service you hereby grant to PhotoDrop and the Owner of any gallery you submit your User Content to a non-exclusive, transferable, sublicensable, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, copy, modify, create derivative works based upon, distribute, publicly display, publicly perform and distribute your User Content in connection with operating, marketing, and providing the Service.  We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a license to use it.  Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you want.
                <br /><br />
                You are solely responsible for all your User Content. You represent and warrant that you own all your User Content or you have all rights that are necessary to grant us the license rights in your User Content under these Terms. You also represent and warrant that neither your User Content, nor your use and provision of your User Content to be made available through the Service, nor any use of your User Content by PhotoDrop on or through the Service will infringe, misappropriate or violate a third party’s intellectual property rights, or rights of publicity or privacy, or result in the violation of any applicable law or regulation.
                <br /><br />
                You can remove your User Content by specifically deleting it. However, in certain instances, some of your User Content (such as photos, posts or comments you make) may not be completely removed and copies of your User Content may continue to exist on the Service. We are not responsible or liable for the removal or deletion of (or the failure to remove or delete) any of your User Content.
                <br /><br />
                Rights in Content Granted by PhotoDrop
                Subject to your compliance with these Terms, PhotoDrop grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to download, view, copy, print, and display one copy of the Content solely in connection with your permitted use of the Service and solely for your personal, non-commercial purposes.
                <br /><br />
                Fees for Services
                You agree to pay PhotoDrop any fees for each Service you purchase or use (including any overage fees), in accordance with the pricing and payment terms presented to you for that Service. Where applicable, you will be billed using the billing method you select through our checkout. Fees paid by you are non-refundable, except as provided in these Terms or when required by law.
                <br /><br />
                Services Terms
                These Terms of Use apply to your access to and use of the Site, the Professional Services (as defined below) and any other apps and online services provided by PhotoDrop (the “Services”). These Terms of Use also apply to your use of the Services to purchase photographic prints or other related merchandise and products (“Products”) through PhotoDrop’s approved third party vendors and retailers (“PhotoDrop Vendors”).
                <br /><br />
                Your use of the Services and your purchase of Products is expressly conditioned upon your agreement to these Terms of Use. If you do not consent to these Terms of Use, you are not permitted to use PhotoDrop or any PhotoDrop Services. If you access the Services on behalf of a company or other entity, you warrant that you are an authorized representative of such company or entity with the right to bind such company or entity to these Terms of Use.
                <br /><br />
                The Services are not targeted towards, nor intended for use by, anyone under the age of 13. If you are between the ages of 13 and 18, you may use the Services only under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by these Terms of Use.
                <br /><br />
                These Terms of Use contain provisions that govern how claims that you and PhotoDrop have against each other are resolved (see Section 15 — Dispute Resolution). These Terms of Use also contain provisions requiring you to resolve certain disputes or claims relating to your use of the Services by binding arbitration, rather than in court. If you do not consent to such terms, you are not permitted to use the PhotoDrop Services.
                <br /><br />
                PhotoDrop reserves the right to change, modify, revise or otherwise amend any provision of these Terms of Use, and any other terms, policies or guidelines governing your use of the Services, at any time at its sole discretion by providing notice that the Terms of Use have been modified. Such notice may be provided by sending an email, or by posting a notice on the Site, or by posting the revised Terms of Use on the Site and revising the date at the top of these Terms of Use or by such other form of notice as determined by PhotoDrop. Your continued use of the Services, or your purchase of any Products or the Services following the posting of the revised Terms of Use or other notice will constitute your acceptance of such changes or modifications. Otherwise, any changes or modifications will be effective within thirty (30) days of the posting of the revisions on the Site unless you notify PhotoDrop within such thirty (30) days that you do not agree to the changes and stop using the Services. Therefore, you should review these Terms of Use whenever you access the Services and at least every thirty (30) days to make sure that you understand the terms and conditions that will apply to your use of the Services.
                <br /><br />
                Our Privacy Policy provides information on how PhotoDrop collects, uses and discloses information from all users of the Services and/or information obtained through your purchase of Products through the Services.
                <br /><br />
                Taxes
                Unless otherwise stated, you are responsible for any taxes or duties associated with the sale of the Services, including any related penalties or interest (collectively, “Taxes”). You will pay PhotoDrop for the Services without any reduction for Taxes. If PhotoDrop is obliged to collect or pay Taxes, the Taxes will be invoiced to you, unless you provide PhotoDrop with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority or other documentation providing evidence that no tax should be charged. If you are required by law to withhold any Taxes from your payments to PhotoDrop, you must provide PhotoDrop with an official tax receipt or other appropriate documentation to support such payments. If you use the Services to sell photographs or other services and are obligated, or elect, to collect Taxes from customers, including sales and use tax, on the PhotoDrop platform you are responsible for all requirements, including registration, filing, and remittance to all applicable taxing authorities.
                <br /><br />
                Price Changes
                PhotoDrop may change the fees charged for the Services at any time, provided that, for Services billed on a subscription basis, the change will become effective only at the end of the then-current billing cycle of your Subscription. PhotoDrop will provide you with reasonable prior written notice of any change in fees to give you an opportunity to cancel your Subscription before the change becomes effective.
                <br /><br />
                Overage Fees
                For Services with attendee limits, if the number of users which join an album exceed the limit for the Service initially purchased, PhotoDrop will bill you, and you will owe, the amount for the appropriate package in which the total users who joined the album does not exceed the package attendee limit (“Overage fees”). The amount paid for the Service initially purchased will be credited against the cost of the appropriate package. Unless otherwise stated, any overage fees incurred by you will be billed in arrears. Overage fees which remain unpaid for 30 days after being billed are considered overdue. Failure to pay overage fees when due may result in the applicable Service being limited, suspended, or terminated (subject to applicable legal requirements), which may result in a loss of your data associated with that Service. Any outstanding overage fees not paid will have late fees added, at a rate up to the statutory maximum.
                <br /><br />
                General Prohibitions and Enforcement Rights

                Warranty Disclaimers
                THE SERVICE AND CONTENT ARE PROVIDED “AS IS,” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.

                Dispute Resolution

                Governing Law
                Interpretation of these Terms and any claim relating thereto shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York without regard to its conflict of law provisions. This Dispute Resolution section shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16.

                Agreement to Arbitrate
                You and PhotoDrop agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Service or Content (collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right: (a) to bring an individual action in small claims court and (b) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (the action described in the foregoing clause (b), an “IP Protection Action”). Without limiting the preceding sentence, you will also have the right to litigate any other Dispute if you provide PhotoDrop with written notice of your desire to do so by email at feedback@photodrop.me within thirty (30) days following the date you first accept these Terms (such notice, an “Arbitration Opt-out Notice”). If you don’t provide PhotoDrop with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice within the thirty (30) day period, you will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any Dispute except as expressly set forth in clauses (a) and (b) above. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any IP Protection Action or, if you timely provide PhotoDrop with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, will be the state and federal courts located in the Western District of Texas and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts. Unless you timely provide PhotoDrop with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, you acknowledge and agree that you and PhotoDrop are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action, representative, or private attorney general proceeding. Further, unless both you and PhotoDrop otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class, representative, or private attorney general proceeding. In addition, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and cannot award relief that would affect other users. If this specific limitation on class, representative, private attorney general, or non-individualized declaratory and injunctive relief is held unenforceable as to a particular claim for relief, then that particular claim (and only that claim) shall be severed from arbitration and resolved in court. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this “Dispute Resolution” section will survive any termination of these Terms.

                Arbitration Rules
                The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section. (The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org/arb_med or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.

                Arbitration Process
                A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a general Demand for Arbitration and a separate Demand for Arbitration for California residents) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules. The arbitrator will decide all issues, except that issues regarding the arbitrability of claims, including disputes over the interpretation or enforceability of the limitation on class, representative, private attorney general, or non-individualized declaratory and injunctive relief, shall be for the court to decide.

                Arbitration Location and Procedure
                Unless you and PhotoDrop otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and PhotoDrop submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.

                Arbitrator’s Decision
                The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. PhotoDrop will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration is frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).

                Fees
                Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for relief does not exceed $75,000 in value, PhotoDrop will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).

                Changes
                Notwithstanding the provisions of the “Modification” section above, if PhotoDrop changes this “Dispute Resolution” section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to feedback@photodrop.me) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated” date above or in the date of PhotoDrop’s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and PhotoDrop in accordance with the provisions of this “Dispute Resolution” section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).

                General Terms
                These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between PhotoDrop and you regarding the Service and Content, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between PhotoDrop and you regarding the Service and Content. If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable (either by an arbitrator appointed pursuant to the terms of the “Arbitration” section above or by court of competent jurisdiction, but only if you timely opt out of arbitration by sending us an Arbitration Opt-out Notice in accordance with the terms set forth above), that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without PhotoDrop’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null. PhotoDrop may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.

                Any notices or other communications provided by PhotoDrop under these Terms, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be given: (a) via email; or (b) by posting to the Service. For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.

                PhotoDrop’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of PhotoDrop. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.

                Product Availability and Pricing
                PhotoDrop or the PhotoDrop Vendors may revise or discontinue Product options at any time without prior notice, and Products may become unavailable even after an order is placed. All prices are subject to change without notice.

                Product Descriptions; Pricing; Errors
                PhotoDrop strives to maintain accurate information in the Services and to eliminate any errors. However, we do not warrant that Product descriptions, Photos, pricing or other PhotoDrop Materials are accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. In addition, all weights and size dimensions are approximate. While we make reasonable efforts to accurately display all details of our Product offerings, including the applicable color, please note that the actual color you will see for a Photo depends on the settings of your computer screen and we cannot guarantee that your computer will accurately display all Photo colors. PhotoDrop or a PhotoDrop Vendor reserves the right to format, manipulate or otherwise modify Photos as may be required to satisfy a particular order. If a Product offered by PhotoDrop is not as described or pictured, your sole remedy is to return the Product in unused condition for a refund within thirty (30) days of receipt. In the event of an error, whether contained in the Services, in an order confirmation, in processing an order or otherwise, we reserve the right to correct such error and charge the correct price or cancel the order, and your sole remedy in the event of such error is to cancel your order.
